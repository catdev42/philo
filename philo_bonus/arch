initialize x number of forks as semaphores that can only be accessed by one process at a time

initialize x number of philos processes that exit when they are full or if one dies

problem:
how can we have a struct thats a semaphore that all the threads can exit?
orwe only need access to whether the dinner is finished no?
so we can store that in a semaphore?
